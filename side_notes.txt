Design

Requirements:

REST service with 2 resources:

1. shorten: takes a url as input and outputs a shortened url

2. expand: takes a shortened url as input and outputs the original url

A map is used as an in-memory cache to store the urls

Note:

Usually a base 62 conversion is used as a hash to identify the orignal url. For this small script, there is no conversion used.
A simple counter is used to identify each url

Assumptions:

There is no check on the inputs for a valid url
There is no check for existing url for expand. An empty response will indicate the shortened url does not exist

Challenges

1. Concurrency was an issue but it can be resolved natively by Go using mutex
2. Using a 3rd party curl program to run in windows command prompt gave different results
